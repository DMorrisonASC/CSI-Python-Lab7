# In lab 7 we learned how to read and write files.

# numProcess.py - a simple program (numProcess.py) to read a collection of integers from a text file and produce a printed summary.

# lineNumbers.py - A program that reads a file and output the content as numbered lines and paragraphs. The line numbers are formatted such that they are  right-justified in a # field 5 characters wide, followed by a period, then a space, then the line of text.

# Sample text files are provided.
